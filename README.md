# Here, the following tasks are implemented:

1. Using the Jackson library, write a Java program that reads a JSON file (books.json) and saves the data into a Java collection.
2. Convert the data from this collection to XML format using the JAXB library. Save the resulting XML result to a file.
3. Using any parser (DOM, SAX, StAX) parse the data in a Java application and output to the console information about the book with the largest number of pages.
